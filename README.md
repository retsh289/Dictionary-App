The app is usually free or requires a one-time fee for access, and can be downloaded from an app store or directly from the developer's website. Dictionary apps can also include other features, such as thesauruses, pronunciation guides, word usage examples, and word games. The app can be used by anyone, from students to professionals, to enhance their vocabulary and improve their communication skills. With a dictionary app, users can easily look up the definitions of unfamiliar words and expand their knowledge of the English language.
